          "Every year, industry bodies in Kenya publish more or less the same headline. A large share of both public and private construction projects finish over budget, and a stubborn minority finish so far over budget that they end up in court. On a multi-billion shilling development, even a modest slip can wipe out the developer's margin and leave the contractor chasing final account for years.",
          "The frustrating thing is that most overruns are not caused by one dramatic event. They build up quietly, from decisions made months before the first block is laid. If you understand where the risk actually enters the project, you can design most of it out at concept stage. Below is a plain look at what tends to go wrong on Kenyan sites, and the working habits that keep the good ones on budget.",

          "The single biggest driver of overrun in our experience is a design that isn't ready when the project goes to tender. Drawings are still being marked up, the structural engineer is still resolving foundations, and the developer is still deciding on finishes. A Bill of Quantities produced from an incomplete design will always contain generous provisional sums, and those sums almost always grow.",
          "Closely behind that is unrealistic programming. A client asks for a ten-storey block in twelve months because their financier wants it, the contractor agrees because they want the job, and nobody stops to price the acceleration. Six months in, the programme slips and everyone acts surprised.",
          "The third quiet killer is procurement culture. Kenyan tenders still often go to the lowest bidder rather than the most competent one. A contractor who has priced 15% below the market will find that money somewhere, usually in variations, defects, or a request for extension of time.",

The developer ends up around 20% over budget and roughly six months late.",
          "The same block, run with a live cost plan and monthly reporting, tends to close at Ksh 410 to 420 million. The difference isn't magic. It's just that every commitment was priced, authorised and recorded before it hit the site.",
